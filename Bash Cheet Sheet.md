### System links:

```ln -sfv <file to link> <symlink>```

* s - Create a symbolic link
* f - If the target file already exists, then unlink it so that the link may occur.
* v - Cause ln to be verbose, showing files as they are processed.

### See what processes are running

```htop```

or

```ps aux | grep php```
